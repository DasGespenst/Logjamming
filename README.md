# Logjamming

Here's a list of features I'd like, feel free to add to this list :

1. Hideable interface maximisable by use of a shortcut
2. A working option in the GUI to send gleaned info to the user's email.
3. Ability for the user to edit the amount of time the program runs for.


Possible/existing difficulties in implementing features (add to this too as time goes on) :

Possible :

1. Maximisation shortcut must not match another operating system shortcut.
2. The log-in information used to connect to the address sending the information to the user MUST be obscured somehow.
3. Methods need to be reworked so they are initiated from action listeners.
 
Existing :
